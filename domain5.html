      <h2>Learning objectives</h2>
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Explain governance structures: policies, roles, committees, risk appetite.</li>
        <li>Manage risk: assessments, treatment plans, third-party risk, supply chain security.</li>
        <li>Align with laws, regulations, and frameworks; manage audits and evidence.</li>
        <li>Develop security awareness and training programs.</li>
        <li>Measure program success with metrics and continuous improvement.</li>
      </ul>

      <div>
        <h3>Governance & strategy</h3>
        <p>Security strategy ties to business goals and risk appetite set by leadership. Governance bodies (steering committee, risk council) approve policies and investments.</p>
        <p>Policies cascade to standards and procedures; exceptions require documented risk acceptance.</p>
        <div class="exam-tip">If a control conflicts with business goals, escalate for risk acceptance/avoidance decisions—don’t unilaterally bypass policy.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="card outline">
        <h4>Framework alignment</h4>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>NIST CSF for capability mapping.</li>
          <li>ISO/IEC 27001 for ISMS governance.</li>
          <li>COBIT for IT governance and control objectives.</li>
          <li>Industry regs: PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR depending on context.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="grid two lesson">
      <div>
        <h3>Risk management</h3>
        <p>Perform risk assessments with asset valuation, threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, and impact. Maintain a risk register with owners and due dates.</p>
        <p>Risk treatment options: accept, avoid, mitigate, transfer/share. Use business impact analysis (BIA) for prioritizing resources and continuity plans.</p>
        <p>Third-party risk: questionnaires, audits, SLAs, right-to-audit clauses, continuous monitoring, and secure onboarding/offboarding.</p>
        <div class="exam-tip">Supply chain security often expects answers like code signing, SBOM, vendor assessments, escrow for critical keys, and validating updates.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="card outline">
        <h4>Compliance & evidence</h4>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>Documented controls mapped to requirements; keep artifacts (logs, configurations, training records).</li>
          <li>Separation of duties for audit independence.</li>
          <li>Data sovereignty: ensure storage/processing complies with jurisdictional laws.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="grid two lesson">
      <div>
        <h3>Awareness & training</h3>
        <p>Build role-based programs: general staff (phishing, AUP), developers (secure coding, secret handling), admins (hardening, change control), executives (risk decisions).</p>
        <p>Use multiple delivery methods: microlearning, simulated phishing, tabletop exercises. Measure effectiveness via click rates, quiz scores, and incident reductions.</p>
        <div class="exam-tip">Awareness addresses human risk; it does not replace technical controls. Pair with policies and enforcement.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="card outline">
        <h4>Supply chain focus</h4>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>Vendor onboarding: background checks, security addendum, data handling rules.</li>
          <li>Software integrity: code signing, hash verification, provenance checks.</li>
          <li>Hardware: tamper-evident packaging, trusted suppliers, secure firmware updates.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="grid two lesson">
      <div>
        <h3>Metrics & reporting</h3>
        <p>Define KPIs/KRIs: phishing click rate, patch SLAs, incident MTTD/MTTR, number of critical risks unresolved, percentage of systems with MFA.</p>
        <p>Dashboards for executives highlight trends and residual risk. Use continuous improvement cycles (Plan-Do-Check-Act) to adjust controls.</p>
        <div class="exam-tip">Metrics should be actionable and tied to objectives. “Number of alerts” alone is not useful; “% critical alerts triaged within SLA” is.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="card outline">
        <h4>Common traps</h4>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>Compliance ≠ security; passing an audit doesn’t guarantee risk reduction.</li>
          <li>Training without measurement fails; always track effectiveness.</li>
          <li>Vendor risk is continuous—assess at onboarding and periodically thereafter.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>Domain 5 connects strategy to execution. Strong governance, repeatable risk management, measurable training, and vigilant supply chain oversight keep the program aligned with business objectives and regulatory demands.</p>

      <h2>Quick revision bullets</h2>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li>Policies → standards → procedures; exceptions require documented risk acceptance.</li>
        <li>Risk responses: accept, avoid, mitigate, transfer/share.</li>
        <li>Third-party controls: SLAs, audits, right-to-audit, code signing, SBOM.</li>
        <li>KPIs should tie to objectives (e.g., patch SLA compliance, MFA coverage).</li>
        <li>Awareness must be role-based and measured.</li>
      </ul>
